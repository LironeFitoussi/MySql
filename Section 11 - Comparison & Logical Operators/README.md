In this section, you'll learn how to filter and control your SQL queries using comparison and logical operators. These tools are essential when working with real-world data that requires conditional logic.

---

We start with the **Not Equal** operator (`!=` / `<>`), which helps exclude specific values from your results. It's a simple but powerful way to clean up your queries.

We then look at the **NOT LIKE** operator, perfect for filtering out unwanted string patterns â€” for example, names that *donâ€™t* start with a certain letter.

Next, you'll learn how to use **Greater Than (`>`)** and **Less Than or Equal (`<=`)** to compare numeric or date values and filter accordingly.

Once comparisons are covered, we shift into logic: **AND** lets you require multiple conditions to be true, while **OR** allows flexibility â€” returning results if *any* condition is met.

The **BETWEEN** operator is a great shortcut when you need to filter values within a range, like prices or date intervals.

We then dive deeper into **date comparisons**, showing how to properly match or compare `DATE` and `DATETIME` values in your tables.

The **IN** operator lets you match against a set of possible values, like filtering users from a list of specific countries or IDs.

Next comes **CASE**, SQLâ€™s way of writing conditional logic right inside your queries â€” like an `if/else` for your data.

We also touch on **IS NULL**, which helps you find rows with missing or undefined data.

Finally, you'll apply everything in a practical **Exercise** and walk through a full **Solution**, helping solidify what youâ€™ve learned with hands-on practice.
